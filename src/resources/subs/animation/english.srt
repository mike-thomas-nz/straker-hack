00:00.280 --> 00:03.480
(traditional flute music)

00:03.480 --> 00:05.494
- Our ancestors were amongst the greatest

00:05.494 --> 00:10.494
designers, engineers,
astrologers, scientists.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.610
They got here before Captain Cook.

00:12.610 --> 00:16.270
They sailed a third of
the planet to get here.

00:16.270 --> 00:18.260
In waka that they had designed

00:18.260 --> 00:19.630
that carried a hundred people.

00:19.630 --> 00:21.260
I carry the Maori world view

00:21.260 --> 00:22.960
which is one that says the footprints

00:22.960 --> 00:25.140
that brought you to where you stand today

00:25.140 --> 00:26.610
always lie in front of you.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.700
It's your past that lies in front of you.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.350
The technology that's allowed us

00:30.350 --> 00:32.880
to go to the world is the internet.

00:32.880 --> 00:35.700
I had decided we were
starting this business

00:35.700 --> 00:37.393
and we're going to do it in Dunedin.

00:37.393 --> 00:39.600
We would take on the world from Dunedin.

00:39.600 --> 00:41.860
There's a lovely saying: ta tunga titi.

00:41.860 --> 00:43.380
It's about the muttonbird.

00:43.380 --> 00:47.040
The muttonbird is a bird
that flies the world

00:47.040 --> 00:48.950
looking for opportunities.

00:48.950 --> 00:50.903
Which it always brings home.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.630
We used to say you gotta
think outside the box.

00:54.630 --> 00:57.210
Technology has blown the box away.

00:57.210 --> 00:59.460
We've worked with one of the
leading Formula One teams

00:59.460 --> 01:01.080
and built the simulator that they use

01:01.080 --> 01:02.670
for training their drivers.

01:02.670 --> 01:03.863
We've never built one.

01:04.960 --> 01:07.940
We just did something at the Masters,

01:07.940 --> 01:08.773
at the golf.

01:08.773 --> 01:11.620
I heard one of the people for CBS saying

01:11.620 --> 01:13.750
to somebody they brought into the room.

01:13.750 --> 01:16.553
We brought these Kiwis
up here because we knew

01:16.553 --> 01:17.923
they would make it happen.

01:18.940 --> 01:20.700
It really does come back to story.

01:20.700 --> 01:24.710
I'd like to think that
that's the Maori part of me.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.480
That technology has only ever been

01:27.480 --> 01:29.023
a means to tell a story.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.700
We took people out to see what sailors did

01:32.700 --> 01:34.480
because they were at the peaks.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.180
So let's have people understand the story

01:37.180 --> 01:39.810
and in golf we're using technology

01:39.810 --> 01:44.230
to show exactly why these
people are the best.

01:44.230 --> 01:47.770
Why they deserve us watching them.

01:47.770 --> 01:49.410
And if I think about Formula One

01:49.410 --> 01:51.160
one of the fabulous stories we were able

01:51.160 --> 01:55.350
to start telling there was this
is how good these guys are.

01:55.350 --> 01:58.080
We really like to solve
problems that we think

01:58.080 --> 02:00.050
are interesting and are gonna be fun.

02:00.050 --> 02:03.060
The two things at our
core we like each other

02:03.060 --> 02:05.030
we think the idea is really good

02:05.030 --> 02:07.452
and that is how you put the deal together.

02:07.452 --> 02:09.423
It's a different way of thinking.

02:10.260 --> 02:14.470
The people we work with,
they're not a client,

02:14.470 --> 02:17.283
they're part of the family;
don't let them down.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.230
But actually as you look
back at relationships

02:21.230 --> 02:24.830
you see how you got to where you are.

02:24.830 --> 02:27.020
It doesn't mean your future's at your back

02:27.020 --> 02:31.273
it means you walk forward
seeing that past all the time.

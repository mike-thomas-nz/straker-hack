00:08.000 --> 00:12.000
<v Rocket Guy>Nothing to do with what this guy is saying

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
<v Rocket Guy>But I'm much more interesting than him.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.000
<v Rocket Guy>[ROCKET LABS]

00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
<v Rocket Guy>Believe me

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
<v Rocket Guy>My sheet of paper had a lot of cool drawings.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
<v Rocket Guy>Much better than his paper.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.000
<v Rocket Guy>I launched for five dollars.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.000
<v Rocket Guy>Absurd indeed.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
<v Rocket Guy>Why don't you just make some wings and fly to space?

00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
<v Rocket Guy>blargh

<v Rocket Guy>Goodbye

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
<v Rocket Guy>I'm leaving now.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
<v Rocket Guy>Just kidding, lol.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
<v Rocket Guy>You were fooled, weren't you?

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
<v Rocket Guy>I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

01:00.000 --> 01:04.000
<v Rocket Guy>Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
<v Rocket Guy>Well, do ya?

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
<v Rocket Guy>This guy really talks a lot.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.000
<v Rocket Guy>Talking about rocket hybrids...

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
<v Rocket Guy>I wonder...

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
<v Rocket Guy>It is as fuel-efficient as a Prius?

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
<v Rocket Guy>I'm getting bored of this

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
<v Rocket Guy>Help me, I'm trapped in this video!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
<v Rocket Guy>How did I get in here?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
<v Rocket Guy>There are rockets in here

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
<v Rocket Guy>Maybe I can shoot one at the screen.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
<v Rocket Guy>...

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
<v Rocket Guy>How would you steal a rocket?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
<v Rocket Guy>Easy, I've played enough GTA to steal a rocket

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
<v Rocket Guy>Alright, goodbye for real.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
<v Rocket Guy>See you on the other side.

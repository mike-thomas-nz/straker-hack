00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,051
Hello

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,051
I am a subtitle

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,051
Nothing to do with what this guy is saying

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,051
But I'm much more interesting than him.

5
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,785
[ROCKET LABS]

6
00:00:17,993 --> 00:00:19,119
Believe me

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,251
My sheet of paper had a lot of cool drawings.

8
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:23,094
Much better than his paper.

9
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:25,023
I launched for five dollars.

10
00:00:27,002 --> 00:00:28,469
Absurd indeed.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,867
Why don't you just make some wings and fly to space?

12
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,640
blargh

13
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:38,403
Lalala I am a subtitle on multiple lines
isn't that interesting?

14
00:00:38,814 --> 00:00:40,782
Goodbye

15
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:43,008
I'm leaving now.

16
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:49,652
Just kidding, lol.

17
00:00:51,226 --> 00:00:53,990
You were fooled, weren't you?

18
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,999
I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

19
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:04,032
Do you feel lucky, punk?

20
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:08,839
Well, do ya?

21
00:01:09,144 --> 00:01:12,705
This guy really talks a lot.

22
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:16,310
Talking about rocket hybrids...

23
00:01:16,718 --> 00:01:18,345
I wonder...

24
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:26,400
It is as fuel-efficient as a Prius?

25
00:01:36,872 --> 00:01:38,203
I'm getting bored of this

26
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,794
Help me, I'm trapped in this video!

27
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,354
How did I get in here?

28
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,988
There are rockets in here

29
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,098
Maybe I can shoot one at the screen.

30
00:02:48,203 --> 00:02:50,068
...

31
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,263
How would you steal a rocket?

32
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,340
Easy, I've played enough GTA to steal a rocket

33
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,000
Alright, goodbye for real.

34
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,346
See you on the other side.

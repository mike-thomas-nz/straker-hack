00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
<v Rocket Guy>Nothing to do with what this guy is saying

00:00:12 --> 00:00:16
<v Rocket Guy>But I'm much more interesting than him.

00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
<v Rocket Guy>[ROCKET LABS]

00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
<v Rocket Guy>Believe me

00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
<v Rocket Guy>My sheet of paper had a lot of cool drawings.

00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
<v Rocket Guy>Much better than his paper.

00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
<v Rocket Guy>I launched for five dollars.

00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
<v Rocket Guy>Absurd indeed.

00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
<v Rocket Guy>Why don't you just make some wings and fly to space?

00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
<v Rocket Guy>blargh

00:00:33 --> 00:00:38
<v Rocket Guy>Lalala I am a subtitle on multiple lines isn't that interesting?

00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
<v Rocket Guy>Goodbye

00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
<v Rocket Guy>I'm leaving now.

00:00:45 --> 00:00:49
<v Rocket Guy>Just kidding, lol.

00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
<v Rocket Guy>You were fooled, weren't you?

00:00:55 --> 00:00:59
<v Rocket Guy>I love the smell of napalm in the morning.

00:01:00 --> 00:01:04
<v Rocket Guy>Do you feel lucky, punk?

00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
<v Rocket Guy>Well, do ya?

00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
<v Rocket Guy>This guy really talks a lot.

00:01:13 --> 00:01:16
<v Rocket Guy>Talking about rocket hybrids...

00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
<v Rocket Guy>I wonder...

00:01:20 --> 00:01:26
<v Rocket Guy>It is as fuel-efficient as a Prius?

00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
<v Rocket Guy>I'm getting bored of this

00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
<v Rocket Guy>Help me, I'm trapped in this video!

00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
<v Rocket Guy>How did I get in here?

00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
<v Rocket Guy>There are rockets in here

00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
<v Rocket Guy>Maybe I can shoot one at the screen.

00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
<v Rocket Guy>...

00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
<v Rocket Guy>How would you steal a rocket?

00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
<v Rocket Guy>Easy, I've played enough GTA to steal a rocket

00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
<v Rocket Guy>Alright, goodbye for real.

00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
<v Rocket Guy>See you on the other side.

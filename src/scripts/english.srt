1
00:03.000 --> 00:04.000
- The whole point of Rocket Lab

2
00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
is about democratising space,

3
00:05.000 --> 00:08.000
and making space available for everybody.

4
00:08.000 --> 00:10.000
It's an incredibly exciting
time in space right now.

5
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
We're right on that tipping point

6
00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
of space being a
commercially-dominated domain

7
00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
rather than a government-dominated domain.

8
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000
We started with a blank sheet of paper.

9
00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
And we said,

10
00:20.000 --> 00:23.000
we want a launch for under
$5 million every week.

11
00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
That's a pretty absurd statement
in the aerospace industry.

12
00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
When you consider the average cost

13
00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
of a launch vehicle is about $180 million,

14
00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
and America as a country

15
00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
went to space around about 20 times.

16
00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
But the whole point is,
that piece of paper,

17
00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
those two requirements drove
everything that we did.

18
00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Whether it be launch sites or engineering

19
00:41.000 --> 00:42.000
or design and development.

20
00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
We really took a very different approach,

21
00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
we invested in lots of
emerging technologies.

22
00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
When we started 3D
printing rocket engines,

23
00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
we could see that technology

24
00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
was going to play a very disruptive role

25
00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
in trying to achieve what
we wanted to achieve.

26
00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
And that can be said for

27
00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
a number of the technologies
in the launch vehicle.

28
01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Rutherford is a very unique engine;

29
01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
it's an electric turbo-pump cycle,

30
01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
so it's like a hybrid of
a rocket and electronics.

31
01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
We created that cycle
because it was the only cycle

32
01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
that was going to meet our requirements

33
01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
for launching weekly.

34
01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Normally you measure the time

35
01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
to build a rocket engine in months.

36
01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
We need to measure it in hours.

37
01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So with 3D printing,

38
01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
we're able to print one
rocket engine every 24 hours.

39
01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
And we've always,

40
01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
we've been very clear
that we want to launch

41
01:25.000 --> 01:28.000
at least once a week,
over 50 times a year.

42
01:28.000 --> 01:31.000
Contrast that to America, as a country,

43
01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
launching 20 times a year.

44
01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
So if we're successful,

45
01:34.000 --> 01:37.000
we'll be launching more as a
company than most countries.

46
01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
All the launch sites in the
world are government-owned.

47
01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
So we created the only and the first

48
01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
fully-private orbital launch site.

49
01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I think if you wrote down everything

50
01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
on the piece of paper that you had to do

51
01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
bilateral treaties, space
agencies, legislation,

52
01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
building launch vehicles, launch site,

53
01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
it looks a little bit scary.

54
01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
From my perspective,

55
01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
New Zealand's a fantastic place
for really really high tech.

56
02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Especially where there's
a regulatory element,

57
02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
because I think one of New
Zealand's unique propositions

58
02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
is the tricky regulatory stuff

59
02:08.000 --> 02:10.000
can be dealt with very pragmatically.

60
02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
It's a very straightforward
and very transparent

61
02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
and innovative place to do business.

62
02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
To go to space and to
consistently go to space,

63
02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
you need a certain level of
infrastructure and governance,

64
02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
and quite frankly just
sheer capital intelligence.

65
02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I think that's a real
strength of New Zealanders.

66
02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
For us it's not so much the technologies

67
02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
that have been developed in New Zealand,

68
02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
but more so the very very
clever and educated people

69
02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
with the New Zealand attitude

70
02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
of happy to push the boundaries.

71
02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
Space is one of those things
that automatically defines

72
02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
what level your country is operating at.

73
02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
At the very peak of engineering.

74
02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
And that's kind of the reality.

75
02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
We expect to see quite an
influx of space companies

76
02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
coming down to New Zealand.

77
02:59.000 --> 03:03.000
(upbeat instrumental music)
